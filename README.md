URL Structure
-------------

[index.html](./index.html) and anything in [static/](./static/) will be served as is, everything else maps to the Python file
[main.py](./main.py), so we can do what we want with it.

As such, it makes sense to keep the JavaScript / css files that we may
need in [static/](./static/).
